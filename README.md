# Dictionaries
Dictionaries (or dict in Python) are a way of storing elements just like you would in a Python list. But, rather than accessing elements using its index, you assign a fixed key to it and access the element using the key. What you now deal with is a "key-value" pair, which is sometimes a more appropriate data structure for many problem instead of a simple list. You will often have to deal with dictionaries when doing data science, which makes dictionary comprehension a skill that you will want to master.
# Pandas & DataFrames 
Pandas is a popular Python package for data science, and with good reason: it offers powerful, expressive and flexible data structures that make data manipulation and analysis easy, among many other things. The DataFrame is one of these structures. This tutorial covers the basics of Pandas DataFrames.
